description: Record the pull requests you opened and merged into your work file.

Integrations are optional. The default work file contains only `## Focus` and
`## Log`; integration sections are created lazily when activity is fetched.

GitHub fetching records pull requests you opened or merged.

## Setup

1. Fetch today's activity:

   ```sh
   swelog fetch github
   ```

   The first run asks for a
   [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the
   `repo` scope and stores it in your operating system keyring.

2. To fetch a previous date, provide `MM-DD-YYYY`:

   ```sh
   swelog fetch github --date 08-17-2026
   ```

## Output

The command creates or updates a managed `## GitHub` section before `## Log`.

:::caution[Managed sections are generated data]
Swelog surrounds generated sections with invisible HTML markers. Treat the
content inside these managed blocks as generated, because future fetches replace
it.
:::

Never store the GitHub token in `swelog.json` — see
[Authentication](/reference/authentication/).
